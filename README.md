## Hi there 👋

<!--
**rohittt21/rohittt21** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
🔭 I’m currently working on exciting Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects—sometimes they work, sometimes they just politely refuse. 😅

🌱 I’m currently learning how to make AI models that don’t hallucinate... too much. Also diving into investment strategies because why not make money while the AI trains? 📈🤖

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to Machine Learning, NLP, and Data Science! Bonus points if it involves cool real-world applications.

🤔 I’m looking for help with optimizing ML models so they don’t take longer to train than the age of the universe.

💬 Ask me about Data Science, Deep Learning, Python, or how to convince your ML model that overfitting is bad.

⚡ Fun fact: My models may overfit, but my coffee consumption never does! ☕
